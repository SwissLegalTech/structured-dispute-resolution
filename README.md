# LEXEM
## The e-Management-System: Litigation ends here.
### 1. The Problem
Law is about language, language about communication and legal communication is a mess. This mess is created due to inefficient communication in legal proceedings. Instead of establishing a factual base and exchanging legal opinions ad hoc, court documents take time to travel (as paper docs) and it's content is unstructured. This causes a massive delay in legal decision-making and very often burries the presiding judge in paper-work.
### 2. The Solution
We bring structure into the mess. The LEXEM e-Management-System is a live platform, that brings claimant, respondent and deciding judge together. The claimant will be able to file his claim, provide legal opinions, facts and proofs. The respondent can reply in relation to the issues addressed by the claimant and raise formulate his defense. The deciding judge will be able to review the process anytime, make private annotations and provide notices where necessary.

### 3. Market and Scalability

### 4. Future Development
