## The e-Management-System: Litigation ends here.
### 1. The Problem
Law is about language, language about communication and legal communication is a mess. This mess is created due to inefficient communication in legal proceedings. Instead of establishing a factual base and exchanging legal opinions ad hoc, court documents take time to travel (as paper docs) and it's content is unstructured. This causes a massive delay in legal decision-making and very often burries the presiding judge in paper-work.
### 2. The Solution
We bring structure into the mess. The LEXEM e-Management-System is a live platform, that brings claimant, respondent and deciding judge together. The claimant will be able to file his claim, provide legal opinions, facts and proofs. The respondent can reply in relation to the issues addressed by the claimant and formulate his defense. The deciding judge will be able to review the process anytime, make private annotations and provide notices to the parties where necessary.

Each year in Germany alone about 1.3 Million first instance civil cases are filed. Decisions for small claims (up to 5,000.- EUR) take 4.9 months and decisions on non-small claims take 9.8 months in average (cf. BMJ statistics on 'Geschäftsentwicklung der Zivilsachen in der Eingangs- und Rechtsmittelinstanz für das Jahr 2016'). Our solution will strenghten the access to justice enabling justices to make more decisions and to decide each and every single case faster.
### 3. Market and Scalability
The German legal services market alone created a turnover of 23.241 Billion EUR in 2015 (cf. pos. 69.1, 'Jahrbuch des statistischen Bundesamtes 2017'). Taking into consideration our solution will mostly apply with 'bread-and-butter' legal proceedings, excluding 'large' and 'specialized' cases (the top 100 German law firms had a turnover of 5.91 Billion EUR in 2016/2017, cf. JUVE Kanzleiumsätze 2016/2017), it could still - conservatively - assmued, that the totally addressable market amouts to about 10 Billion EUR.


As the logic of our plattform applies to any constellation where legal rules apply and parties raise disputes about the law and the facts, our solution can be used in all these contexs (e.g. all Civil Law systems, arbitration and many Common Law constellations).
### 4. SAS Business Model
LEXEM will be provided as software as a service.
