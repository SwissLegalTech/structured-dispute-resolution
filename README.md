## The e-Management-System: Litigation ends here.
### 1. The Problem
Law is about language, language about communication and legal communication is a mess. This mess is created due to inefficient communication in legal proceedings. Instead of establishing a factual base and exchanging legal opinions ad hoc, court documents take time to travel (as paper docs) and the content is unstructured. This causes a massive delay in legal decision-making and very often burries the presiding judge in paper-work.
### 2. The Solution
We bring structure into the mess. 


### 3. Market and Scalability



### 4. Future Development
